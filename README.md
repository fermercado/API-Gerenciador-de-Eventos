# Event Management API

## üåü Introduction

Welcome to the Event Management API! This project is a backend application developed with Node.js and TypeScript, focused on event management. It includes technologies such as Express.js, Yup for validation, JWT authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, Jest for unit testing, API documentation via Swagger, MongoDB, ESLint and Prettier for code quality, as well as the use of `dotenv` for environment variable management and `Docker` for containerization and deployment.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Node.js & TypeScript**: For a robust backend with strong typing.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Yup**: For schema validation.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For authentication and route security.
- **Bcrypt**: Used for password hashing.
- **Jest**: For efficient unit testing.
- **Swagger**: For interactive API documentation.
- **MongoDB**: As a NoSQL database.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: To keep code consistent and clean.
- **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **Docker**: For containerization and facilitating deployment.
